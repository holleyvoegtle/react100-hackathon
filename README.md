# React Starter w/ Express Server, using Webpack

The purpose of this project was to create our own app in React. There was a project template that was used to as a bolierplate. It had minimal dependencies and had a server route that you can use to proxy requests without exposing your api keys. But for this particular app, a public API was found. The initial directions are as followed:

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

Run the build
```
$ npm run build
```

Start the server
```
$ npm run start
```

From there, code was created to create a Dad Joke generator. Once completed, the app was pushed to [Heroku](https://hvdadapp.herokuapp.com/)
